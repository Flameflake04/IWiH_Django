ENROLLMENT OF WOMEN IN CARDIOVASCULAR CLINICAL TRIALS
FUNDED BY THE NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE

ABSTRACT
Background With the recognition that certain aspects of cardiovascular disease are specific to sex,
the U.S. government has sought to ensure that federally funded clinical research yields adequate highquality information about heart disease in women.
Methods We tabulated the numbers of men and
women in cardiovascular clinical trials funded by the
National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) between 1965 and 1998, recording both total numbers
and the numbers for each type of cardiovascular disease. We analyzed the data according to the sex-specific prevalence of disease and assessed changes in
enrollment over time. We performed a similar analysis after excluding all single-sex trials.
Results A total of 398,801 subjects (215,796 women and 183,005 men) were enrolled in NHLBI-funded
studies of cardiovascular disease. The overall enrollment rate for women (54 percent) exceeded the prevalence of cardiovascular disease in women in the general population (49 percent) and increased over time
(P=0.002). With single-sex trials excluded, the enrollment rate for women was 38 percent, which did not
change significantly over time. In studies of coronary
artery disease and hypertension the rates of enrollment of women were similar to or exceeded the prevalence of these disorders in women. The enrollment
rate increased significantly over time in studies of
coronary artery disease (P<0.001) but not in studies
of hypertension or arrhythmia. Women were underenrolled in studies of heart failure, and the rate of enrollment did not change significantly over time. When
single-sex trials were excluded from the analysis of
enrollment rates according to the prevalence of disease, the results were similar. There was no change in
enrollment rates over time for any category of disease.
Conclusions Federal efforts to increase the representation of women in clinical trials have been moderately successful primarily because of the institution
of a small number of large, single-sex trials involving
coronary artery disease. There has been no change
in the sex composition of cohorts in the majority of
studies of cardiovascular disease. (N Engl J Med 2000;

ARDIOVASCULAR disease is the most
common cause of death in both men and
women in the United States and is increasingly recognized as having sex-specific features. Clinical and epidemiologic studies have shown
that men and women with cardiovascular disease differ with respect to disease processes, clinical presentations, and outcomes.1-3 The recognition of sex-based
differences in cardiovascular disease is a compelling
reason for ensuring that the enrollment of women
in cardiovascular clinical trials is proportional to the
prevalence of cardiovascular disease among women
in the general population.
In 1965, the National Heart Institute, as the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)
was then known, funded its first cardiovascular clinical trial, the Coronary Drug Project. Since then, the
institute has funded a total of 126 cardiovascular
clinical trials. The enrollment of women in clinical trials came under scrutiny in the mid-1980s, with the
realization that less information about treatment was
available for women with cardiovascular disease than
for men with the disease.4 Various federal mandates
and other initiatives have subsequently sought to increase the enrollment of women in clinical trials. We
performed a study to determine how successful these
efforts have been in increasing the enrollment of women in cardiovascular clinical trials conducted by the
NHLBI. In addition, we determined whether the pattern of enrollment differed according to the type of
cardiovascular disease under study.
METHODS
Clinical Trials
On October, 1, 1999, in response to a request filed under the
Freedom of Information Act, the NHLBI provided one of us with
a list of all cardiovascular clinical trials conducted between 1965
and 1998. The information included a brief description of each
trial, the date of its inception, and the numbers of enrolled men and
women (including boys and girls in studies of congenital heart disease). Actual numbers were provided for studies conducted before
1995 and predicted numbers for more recent studies. Of the 126
clinical trials, 5 were initiated before the NHLBI required that re-

cent). In addition, the enrollment of women as a percentage of overall enrollment increased significantly
over time (r=0.57, P=0.002) (Fig. 1). However, half
the women were enrolled in two large, single-sex trials investigating the primary prevention of coronary
artery disease: the Women’s Health Study (an investigation of the protective effects of aspirin and vitamin E in 39,876 women, started in 1991) and the
Women’s Health Initiative (an investigation of hormone-replacement therapy and diet in 68,135 women,
started in 1992). With all single-sex trials excluded
from the analysis, the total number of enrolled subjects was 205,810, of whom 38 percent were women
(Table 2). Furthermore, in trials that enrolled both
men and women, the percentage of women did not
increase significantly over time (r=0.08) (Fig. 2).
In mixed and single-sex studies of coronary artery
disease and hypertension, the enrollment rates for
women were proportional to or greater than the prevalences of these disorders among women in the general population (Table 1). The enrollment of women
increased significantly over time in studies of coronary artery disease (r=0.74, P<0.001) but not in
studies of hypertension (r=0.31, P=0.29). In contrast, in all trials that investigated heart failure, women were underenrolled (Table 1), and the enrollment
of women in trials investigating heart failure or arrhythmia did not change significantly over time.
With single-sex clinical trials excluded from the
analysis, the enrollment rate for women was proportional to the sex-specific prevalence for studies of coronary artery disease and hypertension but not for
studies of heart failure (Table 2). For all three disorders, there was no significant change over time in the
proportion of women enrolled in studies (r=0.07 to
0.11, P=0.64 to 0.86) (Fig. 3). However, there was
an abrupt increase in the proportion of women enrolled in studies of coronary artery disease in the mid1980s, with minimal subsequent changes.

searchers document the sex of subjects enrolled in clinical trials;
since the sex of the 1291 subjects enrolled in these 5 trials was not
recorded, they were excluded from the analysis. The 121 remaining
trials were categorized according to the type of cardiovascular disease being investigated (heart failure, coronary artery disease, hypertension, congenital heart disease, arrhythmias, or other). The numbers of men and women were tabulated according to the category
of disease and according to whether the study was a mixed or single-sex trial (there were 54,449 men in 8 trials that enrolled only
men and 138,542 women in 14 trials that enrolled only women).
Sex-Specific Prevalence
Data on the sex-specific prevalence of cardiovascular disease in
general and of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and heart
failure were obtained from the American Heart Association (www.
americanheart.org) and compared with the enrollment rates for
men and women in the 121 clinical trials. Given the heterogeneity
of arrhythmias, data on their sex-specific prevalence may be misleading. For this reason and because the data were not easily obtained, arrhythmias and congenital heart disease were not included
in the comparison. For cardiovascular disease in general, coronary
artery disease, and heart failure, data on patients between the ages
of 45 and 74 years were used. The data were tabulated on the assumption that the size of the population was the same for each
decade of age. The sources of the data were the third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, the National Center
for Health Statistics, and the American Heart Association. For hypertension, data on patients between the ages of 20 and 74 years
were used, and the source of the data was the National Center
for Health Statistics.
Statistical Analysis
The percentage of women enrolled in each trial was calculated.
A linear regression analysis was performed to assess the relation
between the starting date of the trial and the proportion of women
enrolled. The results are expressed as correlation coefficients. All
reported P values are two-tailed.

RESULTS

A total of 398,801 subjects, including 215,796
women and 183,005 men, were enrolled in cardiovascular clinical trials funded by the NHLBI between
1965 and 1998 (Table 1). The overall enrollment rate

DISCUSSION

Efforts to increase the enrollment of women in
studies of cardiovascular disease funded by the NHLBI
have been partially successful. In studies of coronary artery disease performed since the mid-1980s
and in studies of hypertension performed since the
mid-1960s, the rates of enrollment of women have
been proportional to the sex-specific prevalence of
disease.
Two shifts in thinking have contributed to efforts
to increase the representation of women in cardiovascular clinical trials. The first was scientific and was
based on a growing appreciation of the differences
in the pathophysiology, presentation, treatment, and
outcomes of cardiovascular disease in women and in
men. Since comparatively little information was available to guide decisions about the treatment of cardiovascular disease in women, there was a call for clin-

ical trials that would generate the data necessary for
the practice of evidence-based medicine involving female patients. The second shift was societal — the
movement away from a protectionist approach to the
selection of research subjects, as women demanded
greater autonomy in all matters of health, including
the decision to participate in clinical trials. The combination of these two forces has led to a number of
federal regulations designed to include more women
in clinical trials in general, and in cardiovascular studies in particular.
Federal recognition of the need to include larger
numbers of women in clinical trials began in 1985,
with the recommendation of the Public Health Service’s Task Force on Women’s Health Issues that more
attention be paid to research on women’s health.5 In
response, the National Institutes of Health (NIH)

ulated that if women were to be excluded from a
clinical trial, a satisfactory explanation would have to
be provided by the researchers before their grant
application would be approved.6 In 1990, the General Accounting Office concluded that these recommendations had been unevenly applied.7 The NIH
and the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health
Administration, in turn, instituted the requirement
that all grant applications for clinical studies include
a study design with a sex composition that was “appropriate to the known incidence/prevalence of the
disease or condition studied.”8 In addition, the Office of Research on Women’s Health was established
to ensure fair representation of the sexes in all studies funded by the NIH. In 1992, the Public Health
Service Action Plan for Women’s Health was initiated
to “implement policy regarding inclusion of women
in National Institutes of Health–supported clinical
research.”9 In 1993, the National Institutes of Health
Revitalization Act (Public Law 103-43) required the
inclusion of women in every clinical trial involving a
disorder that affects women and directed the NIH
to “ensure that the trial is designed and carried out
in a manner sufficient to provide for a valid analysis
of whether the variables being studied in the trial affect women [and men] differently.”10-12 The costs of
including women would not be a “permissible consideration” for waiving the requirement.
Since there have been no substantial increases in
the proportion of women enrolled in mixed-sex trials
over the past 30 years, our data indicate that, apart
from single-sex trials, the temporal patterns of enrollment of women and men in NHLBI-funded cardiovascular clinical trials appear to be unrelated to
the federal mandates with regard to the sex composition of study cohorts. The one observed increase
in the enrollment of women — in studies of coronary artery disease in the mid-1980s — is abrupt and
difficult to attribute to the federal mandates, since it
478 ·

predated most of them. The growing awareness of the
importance of biologic differences between men and
women and the enunciation of the right of women
to participate in clinical trials may have played a part.
The federal regulations have altered the sex composition of clinical trials primarily through the institution of large trials restricted to women. Although
these trials are an appropriate solution to the problem, they should not be allowed to obscure the underrepresentation of women in studies of particular
types of cardiovascular disease. Most of the trials that
have enrolled only women have investigated coronary
artery disease; few of these trials have focused on hypertension, and none on heart failure or arrhythmias.
Thus, the Women’s Health Initiative and other clinical trials that have enrolled women exclusively do
not cover the broad spectrum of cardiovascular diseases that affect women as well as men.
In a 1993 editorial, Angell cautioned against the
development of a new medical specialty for women’s
health, stating, “It would marginalize the care of women and leave the mainstream to men, where the lack
of attention to women’s health would then be officially sanctioned.”13 Care must be taken to ensure that
with the current pattern of enrollment in NHLBIfunded cardiovascular clinical trials, including several
large trials focused on a limited number of issues in
coronary artery disease in women, broader issues in
coronary artery disease and in cardiovascular disease
in general are not neglected. However, to the extent
that trials restricted to women can provide answers
to specific questions, some of which have already been
addressed in men, they may help correct the underenrollment of women in studies of coronary artery
disease before the mid-1980s.
Although the enrollment of women in studies of
coronary artery disease has exceeded the prevalence
of the disease as a result of single-sex trials, the enrollment of women in mixed-sex trials has been com-

mensurate with the prevalence of the disease in women. This is an important point, because trials such as
the Women’s Health Initiative address a limited set
of questions, and broader questions must be examined in clinical trials involving both men and women.
However, for such trials to address sex-related differences effectively, as required by federal regulations,
subgroup analyses must be included in the study design, and the study population must be large enough
to draw valid conclusions separately for women and

for men. Recent data suggest that such analyses are
performed infrequently.14
Previous justifications for the underenrollment of
women in clinical trials included concern about the
safety of women of childbearing potential and of pregnant women and their fetuses; barriers to participation, such as the general unwillingness of women to
volunteer for participation in studies; and the tendency for women to withdraw from studies before
their completion. The adequate enrollment of women

in studies of hypertension and coronary artery disease, however, strongly discounts these claims, indicating that women are both eligible for and willing
to participate in cardiovascular clinical trials. Thus,
the overall underrepresentation of women in studies
of cardiovascular disease in general and in studies of
heart failure specifically cannot be attributed to such
factors. Other barriers may be present.
In view of the importance of sex-based differences in cardiovascular disease, we must obtain the data
required to tailor treatment for women. The pattern
of enrollment of women in studies of coronary artery
disease and hypertension is encouraging, but improvement is needed in other areas. The positive findings
also make it clear that the persistent underenrollment
of women in certain areas is not due to barriers to
their recruitment and retention. Policies designed to
increase the enrollment of women in NHLBI-funded
cardiovascular clinical trials have had mixed results. In
fact, the proportion of women enrolled in trials involving both men and women has not changed significantly, despite a series of federal regulations intended to increase the enrollment of women and ensure
the evaluation of sex-related differences in findings.
What steps can be taken to ensure success in all areas? The problem falls on the shoulders of researchers, funding agencies, and policy makers. More stringent NIH requirements or stricter enforcement of
current regulations may seem punitive to investigators and may act as a disincentive to the performance
of valuable research. The legal requirements that the
levels of enrollment of men and women in NHLBIfunded clinical trials be statistically appropriate and
that sex be considered as an independent variable are
expensive as well as time-consuming; our data cannot
be used to determine the success of this law. Single-

sex clinical trials are potentially appropriate for addressing the persistent underenrollment of women
and for resolving clinical issues that are specific to sex.
However, they are not an adequate solution as long
as the majority of cardiovascular clinical trials continue to underenroll women. The successful resolution of this difficult problem is critical for the prevention and management of cardiovascular disease in
women and men.
