Background. Recent studies have suggested that hemostatic factors and white blood cell count
are predictive of ischemic heart disease (IHD). The relations of fibrinogen, viscosity, and white
blood cell count to the incidence of IHD in the Caerphilly and Speedwell prospective studies are
described.
Methods and Results. The two studies have a common core protocol and are based on a
combined cohort of 4,860 middle-aged men from the general population. The first follow-up was
at a nearly constant interval of 5.1 years in Caerphilly and 3.2 years in Speedwell; 251 major
IHD events had occurred. Age-adjusted relative odds of IHD for men in the top 20% of the
distribution compared with the bottom 20% were 4.1 (95% confidence interval, 2.6-6.5) for
fibrinogen, 4.5 (95% confidence interval, 2.8-7.4) for viscosity, and 3.2 (95% confidence interval,
2.0-4.9) for white blood cell count. Associations with IHD were similar in men who had never
smoked, exsmokers, and current smokers, and the results suggest that at least part of the effect
of smoking on IHD is mediated through fibrinogen, viscosity, and white blood cell count.
Multivariate analysis shows that white blood cell count is an independent risk factor for IHD
as is either fibrinogen or viscosity, or possibly both. Jointly, these three variables significantly
improve the fit of a logistic regression model containing all the main conventional risk factors.
Further, a model including age, smoking habits, fibrinogen, viscosity, and white blood cell count
predicts IHD as well as one in which the three hemostatic/rheological variables are replaced by
total cholesterol, diastolic pressure, and body mass index.
Conclusion. Jointly, fibrinogen, viscosity, and white blood cell count are important risk
factors for IHD. (Circulation 1991;83:836-844)

mumerous epidemiological studies1'2 have
found raised blood pressure, elevated total
cholesterol, and smoking to be major factors associated with an increased risk of ischemic
heart disease (IHD). Nevertheless, on an individual
basis, the prediction of the risk of IHD from levels of
blood pressure, lipids, and smoking is poor.3 There is
evidence4,5 that occlusive thrombi are to be found in
almost all cases of acute myocardial infarction and in

the majority of sudden cardiac deaths. Thus, there
may be a role for hemostatic and rheological factors
in the etiology of the disease. In recent years, there
have been a few reports6-9 relating hemostatic factors to incidence of IHD and other reports10-12
showing white blood cell count to be associated with
risk of the disease.
See p 1098
The Caerphilly and Speedwell studies13 recruited
their joint population of 4,860 middle-aged men
between 1979 and 1983. In addition to the conventional risk factors, measurements were made of a
number of hemostatic and rheological variables. In
the present report of the first follow-up of the two
cohorts, the roles of fibrinogen, plasma viscosity, and
white blood cell count in the incidence of ischemic
heart disease are described.

Methods

Study Populations
In the Caerphilly study,13 a 100% sample including
only men was selected from within a defined area: the
town of Caerphilly plus five adjacent villages. The men
were chosen by date of birth so that they were aged
45-59 years when examined between 1979 and 1983.
A total of 2,512 men were seen- 89% of the 2,818
who were found to be eligible. In the Speedwell
study,'3 a 100% sample including only men was selected from the age/sex registers of 16 general practitioners working from two neighboring health centers
in the Speedwell area of Bristol. These men were
chosen so that they were between 45 and 59 years of
age on September 1, 1978, immediately before the
study began. The men were thus between 45 and 63
years old when examined between 1979 and 1982. A
total of 2,348 men were seen in the recruitment
phase - 92% of the eligible population of 2,550. The
combined cohort thus numbers 4,860 men.

Survey Methods for Recruitment Phase
The two studies were conducted by two teams of
investigators with a common training at the Medical
Research Council Epidemiology Unit, Cardiff, UK.
The two studies had a common core protocol, and
the same laboratories were used for all hematological
tests.
The men were invited to attend an afternoon or
evening clinic. A standard medical and smoking
history was obtained; the London School of Hygiene
and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) chest pain questionnaire was administered; height, weight, and
blood pressure were measured; and a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded. Detailed methods for these, and for the wide range of other
measures made, are described elsewhere.13,14 The
subjects were then asked to return, after an overnight
fast, to an early morning clinic where a blood sample
was taken with minimal venous stasis. Fasting samples were obtained from 4,641 men.

Laboratory Methods
For measurements of fibrinogen, plasma viscosity,
and white blood cell count, the sample was immediately distributed into a specimen tube containing
EDTA. Fibrinogen was estimated by a nephelometric
method after heat precipitation in buffered saline.15
Plasma viscosity was measured on a Harkness viscometer.16 White blood cells were counted on a
Coulter model S-plus (Coulter Corp., Hialeah, Fla.).
In both studies, at least 5% of the samples sent to the
laboratory were unidentifiable split-sample duplicates. Coefficients of variation for these blind duplicates were 7% for fibrinogen, 1-2% for viscosity, and
2-3% for white blood cell count.
Follow-up Procedure
The records of all men at the National Health
Service Central Registry are flagged so that notifica-

837

tion of death is automatic and a copy of the death
certificate is received. Notifications of all admissions
to local hospitals with a diagnosis coded International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 410-414
(ischemic heart disease) are received from the hospital activity analysis (HAA).
Men who were still alive and resided in, or close to,
the original area were invited again to a follow-up
clinic, where the LSHTM chest pain questionnaire,
in particular, was applied again and a second ECG
was recorded. The few men who had moved out of
the respective areas were sent a self-administered
version of the chest pain questionnaire. This last was
used in the follow-up simply to identify events that
might have been myocardial infarctions (see below).
The results reported in the present study refer to
the first follow-up in each area. Considerable efforts
were made to keep the length of follow-up constant
within each area. In the Caerphilly study, the time to
first follow-up was 61±5 (mean±SD) months. In the
Speedwell study, the follow-up interval was 38±3
months. In the Caerphilly study, 90% of the men
were seen between 56 and 67 months after entry into
the study; in the Speedwell study, 90% were seen
between 34 and 41 months.

Definition of Major Incident IHD Events
Three types of major incident IHD events have been
defined: 1) death due to IHD, 2) Clinical myocardial
infarction, and 3) ECG myocardial infarction.
Death due to IHD. All death certificates were
coded by one of us (J.W.G.Y.) according to the ninth
revision of the ICD. Deaths due to IHD are those
coded ICD 410-414. Deaths attributed to other
causes have been treated as non-IHD events.
Clinical myocardial infarction. The LSHTM chest
pain questionnaire was extended to include questions
about hospitalization for severe chest pain. This,
together with HAA notification of admissions coded
ICD 410-414, was used as the basis for a detailed
search of hospital notes to identify events that satisfied the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria
for definite acute myocardial infarction. In the Caerphilly study, this procedure was followed exactly. In
the Speedwell study, the hospital notes were not
available to us at the first follow-up. Instead, we
defined clinical myocardial infarction as either an
HAA-notified admission to hospital that was coded
ICD 410 (acute myocardial infarction) or as any
event for which the general practitioner had a hospital discharge letter that clearly described an episode satisfying the WHO criteria. Any misclassification introduced by this alternative procedure in the
Speedwell study is likely to be very small indeed.
ECG myocardial infarction. The WHO criteria for
acute myocardial infarction include a series of categories based purely on sequential ECGs. We have
included only the first of these WHO categories as an
ECG-defined myocardial infarction: no Q-QS wave
(Minnesota codes 1-1, 1-2, or 1-3) on the recruitment
phase ECG but major or moderate 0-OS waves

(Minnesota codes in the range 1-1-1 through 1-2-5
plus 1-2-7) on the follow-up ECG.

TABLE 1. Incidence of Major Ischemic Heart Disease in Two
Study Areas

Statistical Methods
Adjusted mean differences in the hemostatic/rheological variables between various groups (Tables 2
and 4) have been obtained by analysis of covariance,
using standard multiple regression techniques.
The remainder of the analysis has been performed
using multiple logistic regression analysis with the
occurrence, or not, of a major-incident IHD event as
the dependent variable. Logistic regression takes no
account of the timing of events as is required by other
models, such as that of Cox. However, any model
involving time would face the problem that "time to
event" cannot be known for ECG-defined myocardial
infarction. Men with evidence of IHD when first
examined have not been excluded from the analysis.
Instead, for reasons we give later, we have allowed
for preexistent IHD by including it as a covariate in
the analysis.
The difference in incidence between the two study
areas, Caerphilly and Speedwell, arising from their
different lengths of follow-up has been accommodated by including area as a two-level factor in all
analyses. The assumption that the relations between
incidence of IHD and the independent variables in
the two areas are parallel on the logit scale was
tested, and no statistically significant interactions
were found.
The variables of interest, fibrinogen, viscosity, and
white cell count, have been treated in two ways. First,
their distributions have been divided, within each
area separately, into equal fifths, and results are
presented as the odds of major incident IHD in each
fifth, relative to the odds in the lowest fifth; 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) for these relative odds
have been estimated from the logistic regression
analyses. Second, they have been treated as continuous variables, and the results are presented as
logistic regression coefficients, with standard errors
and significance levels.

Follow-up Status
A total of 132 (5.3%) Caerphilly men and 106
(4.5%) Speedwell men died before the first followup. Eight (0.3%) men in each area could not be
contacted, but 12 of these 16 were known to be alive.
Of the 4,606 men available for examination, 4,399
(96%) completed a chest pain questionnaire, and
4,296 (93%) had a repeat ECG.
Incidence of Major IHD

Incidence of the three types of major IHD event are
shown in Table 1. In total, 251 major events occurred.
The distribution of the three types of IHD event was
very similar in the two areas; 50% were fatal, 39% were
clinical nonfatal myocardial infarction, and 11% were
ECG-defined myocardial infarction.

Missing Data
The remainder of the analysis is based on the 4,641
men who provided a fasting blood sample. Of these
4,641 men, 233 had a major incident IHD event.
Information was missing on smoking habits for 13
men, fibrinogen for 35, viscosity for 32, and white
blood cell count for 26. A total of 4,589 men (among
whom there were 230 major IHD events) had a
complete set of these data.

Fibrinogen, Viscosity, and White Blood Cell Count
Univariate Analyses
Mean levels of fibrinogen, viscosity, and white
blood cell count were all higher in the men who
developed major IHD (Table 2). The mean differences, standardized for age and area, are both large
and highly statistically significant, with t values in
excess of six.
Figure 1 shows relative odds of major incident IHD
by fifths of the distribution of the three variables. The
solid lines show the relative odds adjusted for age
and area. The odds rise steadily as fibrinogen increases so that in the top 20%, relative odds are 4.1
(95% CI, 2.6-6.5). For viscosity, the corresponding
relative odds are 4.5 (95% CI, 2.8-7.4), and for white
blood cell count, they rise steadily to a value of 3.2
(95% CI, 2.0-4.9).
Multivariate Analysis
In assessing the importance of fibrinogen, viscosity,
and white blood cell count as risk factors for IHD,
other risk factors have to be taken into account, and

Preexistent ischemic heart disease. We have previously shown18 that men with preexistent IHD (angina, history of severe chest pain lasting more than half
an hour, and ECG ischemia)19 have raised levels of
fibrinogen, viscosity, and white blood cell count.
Odds of major IHD in these men relative to the odds
in men with no evidence of preexistent IHD range
from 3.0 for possible ECG ischemia to 5.1 for probable ECG ischemia, with angina and history of severe
chest pain in the intermediate range. It is possible,
therefore, that the associations of fibrinogen, viscosity, and white blood cell count with incidence of
major IHD are simply a consequence of preexisting
disease. In fact, this is not so. Mean levels of the
three hemostatic/rheological variables in men who
developed major-incident IHD and those who did
not are shown in Table 4, subdivided by whether any
manifestation of existent disease was present on first
examination. For all three variables, the age- and
area-standardized mean differences are slightly
larger for men with no evidence of preexistent IHD,
and all six mean differences are significantly greater
than zero (p<0.0001 for all three variables for men
without preexistent IHD; p<0.01 for men with preexistent IHD).
Other risk factors. As already described, the solid
lines in Figure 1 show the relative odds of IHD by
fifths of the level of fibrinogen, viscosity, and white
blood cell count adjusted for age and area. The
crosses show the odds further adjusted for both
smoking habit and three separate indicators of preexistent disease (angina, severe chest pain, and ECG
ischemia). For all three variables, this adjustment
reduces the relative odds. Nevertheless, the effects
are still large; the odds of major IHD in the top 20%
of the distributions are still 2.8, 3.5, and 2.3 times the

odds in the lowest 20% for fibrinogen, viscosity, and
white blood cell count, respectively.
The circles on Figure 1 show the effect when the
relative odds are further adjusted for total cholesterol, diastolic blood pressure, and body mass index.
The changes are small. In the top 20% of the
distributions, relative odds are 2.6 (95% CI, 1.6-4.3),
3.2 (95% CI, 1.8-5.6), and 2.2 (95% CI, 1.3-3.5) for
fibrinogen, viscosity, and white blood cell count,
respectively. In three multiple logistic regression
models with the identical sets of variables (except
that fibrinogen, viscosity and white blood cell count
are entered as continuous variables), the regression
coefficients for all three are highly significant

(p<0.000l).

Correlations between the hemostatic/rheological
variables and cholesterol, blood pressure, and body
mass index are small. Viscosity is positively correlated (r=0.2) with total cholesterol and shows small
positive associations (r=0.1) with both diastolic
blood pressure and body mass index. Fibrinogen has
a small positive correlation only with total cholesterol; white blood cell count shows no association
with any of the three.
Fibrinogen, Viscosity, and White Blood Cell Count
Considered Jointly
The three hemostatic/rheological variables are interrelated; the correlation coefficient between fibrinogen and viscosity is 0.57 in both the Caerphilly and
Speedwell studies, and the coefficients for fibrinogen

three variables are considered individually, particularly for fibrinogen and viscosity, but that those for
white blood cell count and viscosity are still statistically significant. However, if only two of the variables,
white blood cell count together with one of either
fibrinogen or viscosity, are entered into the model,
then both are significant atp<0.001.
The addition of total cholesterol (mmol/l), diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg), and body mass index
(kg/m2) (shown as model 2 in Table 5) marginally
increases the coefficients for fibrinogen and white
blood cell count but decreases the coefficient for
viscosity by nearly 30%. Again, however, if only white
blood cell count together with either one of fibrinogen or viscosity is entered into model 2, both are
significant at p<0.001.
To further evaluate the predictive power of these
hemostatic/rheological factors, a third model was
fitted that included only the conventional risk factors: total cholesterol, diastolic blood pressure, and
body mass index (together with age, area, smoking
habit, and preexistent IHD). Comparison of this
third model with the one in which the hemostatic/
rheological tests were also included (model 2 in
Table 5) provides an overall significance test for the
effect of adding fibrinogen, viscosity, and white
blood cell count to a model containing all the
conventional risk factors. The improvement in fit is
highly significant: Y2(3df)=33,p<0.00001.
Fit and Predictive Power of the Logistic Models
From model 1 with fibrinogen, viscosity, and white
blood cell count, a predicted risk for each individual
was calculated. If that distribution of predicted risk is
divided into five equal groups, then the sum of the
individual predicted risks within each fifth is the
number of major IHD events expected under the
logistic model. There was close agreement between
observed and expected events, showing that the
model fitted the data well. Further, the model had

considerable predictive power. Only 10% of observed
events occurred in the bottom 40% of the distribution of predictive risk, whereas nearly 80% occurred
in the top 40%. There were more than 12 times as
many events in the top 20% as in the bottom 20% of
the distribution.
Table 6 compares the predictive power of two
models, both based on the 4,463 men with complete
data (models 1 and 3). The predictive power of the
model with fibrinogen, viscosity, and white blood
cell count is at least as good as that for the model
with total cholesterol, diastolic blood pressure, and
body mass index.

Discussion
When analyzing cohort studies for the association
between risk factors and incidence of disease, it is
common but not universal2 practice to exclude subjects with evidence of IHD on entry. The exclusions
are usually either a very small8 group of men with
previous myocardial infarction or a rather ill-defined
group with clinical symptoms of IHD.20 We have

shown,19 as did the British Regional Heart Study,2
that about 25% of middle-aged British men have
some evidence of IHD and that just over half the
major incident IHD events occurred in this group.
Neither exclusion of a small subgroup nor exclusion
of the whole group containing over half of the events
of interest seems to be satisfactory, and like the
Regional Heart Study, we have included all men in
the analysis.
It could be argued that this inclusion of men with
preexistent IHD increases the possibility that any
relations found are a consequence of the disease
already existing rather than a contribution to its
development. However, this argument only holds
true if the inclusion of men with preexistent disease is
ignored in the analysis. We have allowed for their
presence by including standardized measures of angina, severe chest pain, and ECG ischemia on entry
to the study as covariates in all analyses. Further, we
have shown that the relations between the hemostatic variables and incidence of IHD are similar in
men with and without any evidence of preexistent
disease. In this circumstance, inclusion of all men
and the use of preexistent IHD as a covariate will
result in more accurate estimates of the relations
between possible risk factors and the incidence of
IHD than the alternative of excluding relatively small
groups of men with clinical symptoms and assuming,
incorrectly, that the remainder are disease free.
Whether such relations are causal can, of course,
never be completely answered by any observational
study.
Univariate analyses show that white blood cell
count, fibrinogen, and plasma viscosity are all
strongly associated with the incidence of major IHD.
Adjusting only for age and area, the odds of IHD in
the top 20% of the white blood cell count distribution
are more than three times the odds in the lowest
20%; for fibrinogen and viscosity, the corresponding
relative odds are in excess of four. These relative
odds are larger than those commonly reported',2 for
the more conventional risk factors such as blood
pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol, and body mass index. The important
question is to what extent these associations are
independent of smoking habit, preexistent disease,
and the other conventional risk factors.
White Blood Cell Count
There are a number of studies10-12 in the literature
showing that white blood cell count is associated with
the incidence of disease, but there is disagreement as
to whether this association arises solely because both
are dependent on smoking habit. Zalokar et al"l find
the association only in smokers who inhale and
conclude that white blood cell count is simply an
excellent indicator of exposure to cigarette smoke.
Friedman et al10 and Grimm et al12 both conclude
that part of the association is independent of smoking habit. Our data support this latter conclusion.
Figure 1 shows the relative odds of IHD in the top

20% of the white blood cell count distribution reduced from 3.2 to 2.4 on standardizing for both
smoking habit and preexistent disease. Further adjustment for total cholesterol, diastolic pressure, and
body mass index only reduced the odds to 2.2. This is
a stronger association than that found in the "usual
care" group of the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention
Trial,12 in which similarly adjusted relative odds of
IHD of 1.53 were found in the top third of the white
blood cell count distribution.
It is possible that the association between white
blood cell count and the incidence of IHD is a
consequence of the disease. However, this explanation is rendered less likely by the finding of a highly
significant difference in count between men who
develop the disease and those who do not, among the
men with no evidence of preexistent disease.
Mechanisms that might explain this association
include clumping of granulocytes and monocytes
and subsequent leukoembolism21 and the role of
macrophages and monocytes in the development of
fatty streaks.22,23
Fibrinogen and Viscosity
We have been unable to find any published study
that describes the relation between plasma viscosity
and the incidence of IHD. However, a positive
association with plasma fibrinogen has been reported
in four smaller studies.6-9 In 1,511 middle-aged men,
Meade et al8 found a difference of 0.25 g/l in
thrombin-clottable fibrinogen between men who developed IHD and those who did not. The same
difference was found by Wilhelmsen et a16 in a
random sample of 792 men. Although results were
not reported in exactly this manner, it seems that the
Framingham study9 also found similar differences in
a 12-year follow-up of 554 men and 761 women.
Stone and Thorpe,7 in a study of 297 men, found a
difference of 0.79 g/l using the same nephelometric
method as in the present study. Thrombin-clottable
fibrinogen was also measured in the present study,
but its association with the incidence of IHD was less
strong than that for the nephelometric fibrinogen.
The effects that we have found for fibrinogen and
viscosity are large, and the age-adjusted relative odds
of IHD are in excess of 4 in the top 20% of the
distribution of each. Standardization for smoking
habit and preexistent disease only reduced these
relative odds to about 2.7 for fibrinogen and 3.5 for
viscosity. This shows that the association is not explained by smoking. Furthermore, if preexistent IHD
is caused, even in part, by high "levels"' of the
hemostatic/rheological factors, then we may have
"overcontrolled" for this effect, and our estimations
of relative risks will be conservative. Further standardization for total cholesterol, body mass index,
and diastolic blood pressure produces little additional change in the relative odds.
However, fibrinogen and viscosity are not independent of each other; the correlation coefficient between
them is 0.57. To try to determine which is the more

Yamell et al Hemostatic Factors and Ischemic Heart Disease

important, both fibrinogen and viscosity, together with
white blood cell count, age, area, smoking habit, and
preexistent disease, were put into a multiple logistic
regression model. The results (Table 5) suggest that
white blood cell count is an independent risk factor,
but there is no clear differentiation between fibrinogen and viscosity. When either alone was put into the
model it showed a strong (p<0.001) association with
IHD, and when both were entered, the joint effect was
attributed fairly equally to both. It will be possible to
investigate this more fully as the length of follow-up
increases and more cases of IHD accrue.

Smoking Habit
All categories of smokers had higher risks of
developing major IHD than men who had never
smoked. Relative odds of IHD compared with those
who had never smoked were 2.5 for current smokers
and 2.0 for exsmokers. The large excess risk among
the exsmokers and, particularly, the fact that the risk
is little different in those who gave up more than 10
years ago support the contention of the British
Regional Heart Study24 that part of the excess risk of
IHD due to smoking remains long after quitting.
Although the association between smoking and
IHD has been found by virtually all cohort studies,
there is no clear understanding of the mechanisms
involved. The multiple logistic regression model (Table 5) shows that, when white blood cell count,
fibrinogen, and viscosity are included in the model,
the relative odds of IHD decline to 1.7 for current
smokers and 1.5 for exsmokers. This, together with
the well-known observation17 that levels of all three
variables are raised in smokers, suggests that at least
some of the relation between smoking and IHD is
mediated through an effect on these aspects of
hemostasis and rheology. This hypothesis could explain why the risk in exsmokers does not quickly
revert to that in men who have never smoked. We
have previously shown17 that levels of white blood
cell count, fibrinogen, and viscosity among exsmokers
gradually decline but do not reach the levels of
lifetime nonsmokers even after 10 years.
Conclusion
The joint predictive power of fibrinogen, viscosity,
and white blood cell count is considerable, and when
they are added to a model containing the major
conventional risk factors, there is a highly significant
improvement in the fit of the model. In a multiple
logistic model that included the three together with
age, smoking habit, and preexistent disease markers,
123 (55%) of the major IHD events occurred in the
top 20% of the distribution of predicted risk; in
comparison, only 10 (4%) occurred in the bottom
20% (Table 6). This prediction was at least as good as
that achieved when the three hemostatic/rheological
variables were replaced by the conventional risk
factors of total cholesterol, diastolic pressure, and
body mass index. Individually, white blood cell count

is an independent risk factor as is either fibrinogen or
viscosity, or possibly both.
These findings add substance to the views12,2526
that more work in these under-researched areas
may yield rich dividends. In particular, research
into the life-style determinants of fibrinogen, viscosity, and white blood cell count is required; the only
life-style determinant known at present to have a
substantial effect is smoking.
